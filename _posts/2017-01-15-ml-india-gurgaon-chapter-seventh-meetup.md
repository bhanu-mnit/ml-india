ML-India is pleased to inform that the sixth ML-India meetup in its Gurgaon chapter was held on 18th December 2016.

In this meetup, the members discussed the learnings and the doubts that they had from Week 2 of [CS231](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, a computer vision and deep learning course offered by Stanford. Different members had completed different number of lectures of the MOOC. Accordingly, the members started working on the assignments. There were a couple of new members as well who attended the meetup for the first time. They were made familiar with the course contents and some basic prerequisites one should have before starting the course. 

In the last hour, they discussed the queries of the participants and also had a small discussion around everything that they can add in the meetups to make them better. A common viewpoint that came up was that the willing members could also present their work during the meetup, anyone interested could join him/her and they could be teamed up to work on specific applications. They also proposed to brainstorm some basic ideas for building different applications which utilize machine learning techniques.
