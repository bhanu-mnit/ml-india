We are pleased to inform that the tenth ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held on 25th March 2017.

In this meetup, they had a guest speaker, [Mr. Sainath Adapa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sainathadapa){:target="_blank"}. Sai is a Data Scientist at Sabre Airline Solutions. He completed his B.Tech and M.Tech from IIT-Madras. He talked about his work on making contributions to "ogdindiar", an R package that helps in searching an downloading datasets from data.gov.in
  
They then moved on to begin a workshop on 'Introduction to ML' organized by Sritulasi, also the host of ML-India meetups happening in Bangalore. They covered the basics of ML and did some exercises using Linear & Logistic Regression.

The participants were delighted to be a part of the meetup since it had both theoretical and workshop meterial. One of the beginners mentioned that she felt that the session was very informative and at the same time did not intimidate her. Weâ€™ll keep up with having such engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups. Spread the word to your friends from Bangalore to enroll for the meetups.
