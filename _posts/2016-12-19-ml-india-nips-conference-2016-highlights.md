The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December. The conference is a single track meeting that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. According to Microsoft Academic Search, NIPS is the top conference on machine learning.

NIPS 2016 was held from 5th-10th December, 2016, in Barcelona, Spain. This year, the conference had close to 730 accepted papers and posters along with 50+ workshops and tutorials. The keynote was provided by speakers from FB research, Salk institute, Deep Mind and Boston Dynamics and a couple more. Click [here](https://nips.cc/){:target="_blank"} for more details.
